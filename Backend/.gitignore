# Prevent nodemon from deleting files by not using any destructive commands in your nodemon config.
# If you want to ignore certain files or folders from being watched by nodemon, add them to nodemon.json or .nodemonignore.

# Example .nodemonignore
node_modules/
logs/
*.log

# .gitignore example (to prevent tracking files in git, not related to nodemon deleting files)
node_modules/
.env
logs/
*.log
